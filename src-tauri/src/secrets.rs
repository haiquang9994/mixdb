//! Where a saved connection's passwords live: the operating system's own credential store —
//! Windows Credential Manager, the macOS Keychain, the Secret Service on Linux.
//!
//! Everything else about a saved connection (host, port, user, the sidebar width) stays in
//! `connections.json`, which is plain text by design: it is a list of what you connect to, and it
//! is useful to be able to read and copy it. What must not be in there is the credentials, which
//! is what this module keeps out of it.
//!
//! On macOS all of them share one entry — the vault — rather than keeping one each. The Keychain
//! asks before it hands an item to an application it does not recognise, and it decides what it
//! recognises from the application's code signature; MixDB is not signed, so every update is a
//! stranger to it. The question is asked once per *item*, which with an entry each meant one
//! dialog per saved connection: ten of them at once on the first look at the Database tab. All of
//! them in a single item is one dialog, and the read is cached for the run, so it is one dialog
//! per update rather than one per launch.
//!
//! Windows and Linux keep an entry each, because neither has the problem and Windows would be hurt
//! by the fix: Credential Manager refuses a secret over 2560 bytes, which a dozen connections in
//! one JSON object would pass. It never asks the question at all, and the Secret Service asks to
//! unlock the collection rather than for each item, so on both of them one entry per connection
//! costs nothing and stays well inside what the store will hold.
//!
//! On macOS, an entry written before the vault is moved into it the first time that connection is
//! read, and the old entry removed. There is no way to spare the user the dialogs on that one run:
//! those passwords are sitting in ten separately guarded items, and reading them is exactly what
//! the guard is asking about.
