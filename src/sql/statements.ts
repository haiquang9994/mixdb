/**
 * Carving the Query tab's script into the statements it is made of.
 *
 * This is a port of `split_statements` in `src-tauri/src/db/mysql_script.rs` and
 * `postgres_script.rs`, which are what actually run a script. The backend splits so it can send one
 * statement at a time; the editor splits so it can say which statement the caret is in, run that
 * one alone, and draw it. They must agree — a statement the editor highlights and sends has to be
 * the same one the server ends up running — **so a change to any of the splitters belongs in the
 * same commit as the others**, and in every set of tests:
 * [statements.test.ts](./statements.test.ts) here, `mod tests` there, case for case.
 *
 * One splitter serves both engines: what differs between them is lexical, and travels in a
 * {@link SqlSyntax}. The only thing this port adds over the Rust ones is where each statement sits
 * in the text.
