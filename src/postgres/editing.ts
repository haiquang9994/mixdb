 * The types a PostgreSQL column can be declared as.

 * Written the way PostgreSQL itself writes them, because that is what the dialog is filled from:
 * `format_type` reports a column as `character varying(255)`, not `varchar(255)`, and a type in the
 * list under a different spelling would leave the picker looking empty on a column that has one.
 *
 * A type the list does not carry is still editable — the dialog puts an unknown type at the front
 * of its own options — so this is the reachable set, not the allowed one.

/**
 * What the Structure tab's dialogs offer on PostgreSQL.
 *
 * Four of MySQL's controls are gone rather than disabled. `UNSIGNED` does not exist; a column
 * cannot be put anywhere in particular, since PostgreSQL appends and has no statement that moves
 * one; `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` is a trigger here rather than a property of a column; and
 * neither a database nor a table carries a collation of its own — only its text columns do.
 *
 * What PostgreSQL has more of is access methods: `gin` for a `jsonb` or a `tsvector` column and
 * `brin` for a large table ordered by its key are both worth reaching for, and neither has a MySQL
 * counterpart. They are index *methods* here rather than index kinds, which is why the two kinds
 * MySQL adds instead — `fulltext` and `spatial` — are not on this list.
