/**
 * What the name under the pointer actually is.

 * The editor asks this twice over: once for the tooltip that appears when the pointer rests on a
 * word, and once for `Ctrl+Click`, which needs to know whether the word is a table before it will
 * offer to open one. Both are the same question, so both come through here.
 *
 * The statement is read with the same tokeniser and the same scope reader the checks use — see
 * [lint.ts](./lint.ts). That is the point: an alias resolves to the table the warnings resolve it
 * to, or the two would disagree about the same script.
 *
 * Where the checks stay quiet on anything they cannot model, this is happier to answer. Silence
 * costs a checker its credibility; a tooltip is only ever asked for, so a good guess about a name
 * inside a subquery is worth more than nothing at all.
