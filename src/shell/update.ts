/**
 * Finding a newer MixDB, fetching it, and putting it in place.
 *
 * The whole exchange happens through Tauri's updater plugin, which reads a small `latest.json`
 * published beside the installers, downloads the bundle for this platform and checks it against the
 * public key baked into `tauri.conf.json` before a byte of it is executed. That signature is
 * MixDB's own, and has nothing to do with the Authenticode or Developer ID certificates the app
 * still lacks — which is why the update path can be trusted even though the first install makes
 * Windows and macOS complain.
 *
 * Downloading and installing are kept as two separate steps on purpose. Installing closes MixDB,
 * and a user with unsaved query results should be the one who decides when that happens: the
 * download runs quietly in the background, and only when it is on disk does anything ask.
 *
 * Three small keys in localStorage, beside the theme and the language, remember what the user
 * decided about a version and when the last check ran.
