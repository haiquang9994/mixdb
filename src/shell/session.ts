/**
 * Which tabs were open when the app was last closed, and which of them was in front.
 *
 * What the tab bar itself draws — a tab's id, the module it holds, the name it was carrying — and
 * one opaque slot per tab that the module behind it filled in. This file does not know what is in
 * that slot and never looks: only the module that wrote it can say whether `{ savedId: "…" }` is a
 * connection that still exists, and a shell that could tell would be a shell that knows the
 * database module by name. Everything about the shape of it, and about what may go in there, is in
 * `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-23-tab-session-context-design.md` — §4 in particular: ids only,
 * because this is `localStorage`.
 *
 * A restored tab is a place on the strip, and the module behind it decides what to do with its own
 * slot the first time the tab is looked at.
 *
 * Badges are left out because they cannot be stored: a badge holds a React element. They come back
 * the moment the module mounts and reports them, which is the only time anything knows what they
 * should say.
 *
 * `localStorage`, like `shell/theme.ts` — this is a handful of strings about the window, read once
 * on the way up and written as it changes, and a file on disk read through an async plugin would
 * mean an empty tab bar for the first frame of every launch.
