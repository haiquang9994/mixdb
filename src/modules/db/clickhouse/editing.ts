 * The types a ClickHouse column can be declared as through the dialog.

 * Exactly the whitelist the grid knows how to decode, and no wider: a column that is already an
 * `Array`/`Map`/`Tuple` can still be edited — the dialog puts a type its list has no entry for at
 * the front of its own options — but none can be created from here, because the data grid has no
 * way to show or write one back yet.
 *
 * No entry wraps `Nullable(...)`: nullability is a checkbox of its own, and it wraps around the
 * chosen type when the column is saved. See `ColumnDialog`'s `wrapNullable`.
