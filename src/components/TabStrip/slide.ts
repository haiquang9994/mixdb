/**
 * The tabs slide to their new places instead of jumping there.
 *
 * The reorder is live — a tab changes places under the pointer, mid-drag — and a list that snaps
 * into a new order every few pixels is one nobody can follow. So after every render this compares
 * each tab's position with where it was, and plays the difference backwards: the tab is put back
 * where the eye last saw it and animated to where it now is. The layout is never touched, only the
 * paint, which is why nothing here can disagree with the drag going on above it.
 *
 * `offsetLeft` throughout, never a rectangle: `getBoundingClientRect` includes the very transform
 * this is animating, so measuring with it would compare a tab against its own animation.
 *
 * The one tab left out is the one being carried: it is already following the pointer, and a tab
 * animated towards a place it is being held away from would be two things at once. `useTabReorder`
 * marks it and puts it back itself, in a layout effect that runs after this one.
 *
 * Not only for drags — closing a tab slides the ones after it along too.
