/**
 * Dragging a tab along its strip.
 *
 * The strip keeps the order; this keeps the drag. A caller says what a move means — `moveTab` for a
 * list of tabs, `moveId` for a list of ids, both in `reorder.ts` — and spreads what comes back onto
 * the strip and onto every tab:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const reorder = useTabReorder((from, to, side) => setTabs((prev) => moveTab(prev, from, to, side)));
 * ...
 * <TabStrip {...reorder.strip}>
 *   <Tab {...reorder.tab(tab.id)} active={...} onClose={...}>
 * ```
 *
 * **The tab itself is what moves.** HTML5 drag and drop would have been less code — the browser
 * draws the carried thing for free — but what it draws is a snapshot on a layer of its own, which
 * floats out over the whole window, ignores the strip it belongs to, and leaves the real tab sitting
 * greyed out where it started. Pointer events instead: the tab is translated under the pointer,
 * held to the band the tabs stand in, and never stops being the element on the strip.
 *
 * **The move happens as the tab is carried, not when it is let go.** The tab under the pointer is
 * the tab in its new place, so there is no line to draw promising something that has not happened
 * yet. Letting go only ends the drag, and `Escape` does the same: the tabs have already moved and
 * stay moved — they were never anywhere else to be put back to.
 *
 * **Where the tab is decides, not where the pointer is.** It takes a neighbour's place once it is
 * carried past the middle of it — see `dropTargetAt`, which is where the exact line is drawn. The
 * two part company as soon as the tab is up against either end of the strip, and it is the tab the
 * eye is following.
 *
 * A press only becomes a drag after {@link THRESHOLD}, so a tab is still something you can click.
 * Once it has become one it is no longer a click: letting go of a tab that has been carried — a
 * hand's width or four pixels, far enough to move it or not — does not also select it. Every strip
 * in the app opens something when a tab is picked, and a tab put back where it came from was never
 * a request to open it. That is what `onClickCapture` below is for.
