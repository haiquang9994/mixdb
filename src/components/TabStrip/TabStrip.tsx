/**
 * A strip of tabs: the app's own tab bar, the REST module's open requests, and the strips inside a
 * pane.
 *
 * What is shared here is the drawing, not the behaviour. Which element is selected, what closing
 * one means, whether a tab can be closed at all — every strip answers those differently, and each
 * keeps answering them itself. What none of them should answer differently is what a tab looks
 * like, which is what kept drifting while three files each held their own copy.
 *
 * A tab's contents are children rather than props. The shell puts a connection badge before the
 * name, the REST strip puts the method there, a pane tab is a bare word — passing each of those
 * through a prop would have meant one prop per caller, which is the point at which a shared
 * component costs more than the duplication it replaced.
 *
 * To recolour the open tab's accent bar, set `--tab-accent` on the tab. See `TabStrip.module.css`.
 *
 * **The tabs scroll; what is held at either end does not.** More tabs than room used to mean a
 * scrollbar under the whole strip, the app's own settings button included — so the one control
 * that is there on every screen scrolled away with them. It sits in `leading` now, outside the part
 * that moves, and `[+]` sits in `trailing` for the same reason: both are actions on the strip
 * rather than tabs on it, and an action you have to go looking for is one that has been mislaid.
