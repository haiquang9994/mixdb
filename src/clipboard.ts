/**
 * Putting text on the system clipboard.
 *
 * One place rather than a `navigator.clipboard` call at each site, because the call fails in ways
 * worth answering the same way everywhere: the webview hands the clipboard out only to a secure
 * context and only under a gesture the user made, and a copy that quietly did nothing is the worst
 * of the possible outcomes — the user pastes whatever was on the clipboard before and finds out
 * somewhere else.
 *
 * So a refusal falls back to the old `execCommand` route, which is not held to the same rules, and
 * only a failure of both is reported. What is thrown then is an {@link AppError} like any other, so
 * callers put it through `errorMessage` and show it on the banner they already have.
